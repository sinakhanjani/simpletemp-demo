# SimpleTemp Project 🚀

## Project Overview
SimpleTemp is a modern platform for dental clinics, hygienists, and dental nurses in London, UK. This application simplifies the temporary staffing process by directly connecting clinics with professionals in the dental field. I was the **lead developer for iOS, backend, and frontend**, while the **Android version was developed by another team member**. Additionally, I was **the project manager and the main contractor with the client**. 💼

## How It Works 🔄
- **24/7 Access:** Users can book temporary shifts or submit job proposals anytime.
- **Choose the Right Fit:** Clinics can easily review dental professionals’ profiles and select the best candidate.
- **Transparent Pricing:** Registration is free, and a fee is charged only after a shift is completed.
- **Unmatched Flexibility:** Clinics can book temporary staff from weeks in advance to the night before a shift.
- **Real-time Communication & Support:** Clinics and professionals can communicate through instant messaging and notifications.
- **User Verification:** All clinics and professionals must verify their identity for security and quality assurance.
- **Shift & Invoice Management:** Clinics and professionals can view and manage invoices directly from the platform.
